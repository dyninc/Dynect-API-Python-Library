This is a simple Python wrapper for interacting with the Dynect Managed DNS
REST API.  

As it makes use of a JSON interface, one must either have the simplejson
module installed, or have Python 2.6/2.7 which have a JSON library that comes
with the language.  Python 3.x is not currently specifically supported.

Use is fairly simple:

import sys
from DynectDNS import DynectRest

dynect = DynectRest()

# Log in
arguments = {
	'customer_name': 'my_cust',
	'user_name': 'my_user',  
	'password': 'my_pass',
}
response = dynect.execute('/Session/', 'POST', arguments)

if response['status'] != 'success':
	sys.exit("Incorrect credentials")

# Perform action
response = dynect.execute('/Zone/', 'GET')
zone_resources = response['data']

# Log out, to be polite
dynect.execute('/Session/', 'DELETE')
